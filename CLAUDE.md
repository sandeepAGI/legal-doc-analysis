Let us start with the next item on our backlog - building a token aware document orchestrator
I would like this orchestrator to be dynamic, that looks at all the documents shared with it, the question that is being asked and then make a decision how and what to orchestrate in parallel
Please come up with a plan that we can review, refine and revise as needed before undertaking any coding
Develop unit test to test all changes that are implemented
Run regression tests and only after all tests pass, should we decide whether we are ready to commit changes
Update README.md reflecting all updates
