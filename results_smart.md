**Q: What was the core allegation made by the plaintiff?**
*Processing time: 61.45s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the core allegation made by the plaintiff is that the defendants, including UiPath and its executives, made misleading statements in the prospectus regarding the company's financial condition, business, and results of operations. The plaintiff alleges that these statements were false or omitted material information, which led to a decline in the value of the securities purchased by investors.

**Q: Who were the defendants in this case?**
*Processing time: 7.01s | Retrieved chunks: 3 | Query complexity: simple | Adaptive k: 6 | Est. tokens: 750*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the defendants in this securities litigation are:

* UiPath
* Two of its executives (names not specified)

These conclusions are supported by the following relevant portions from the excerpts:

* The first excerpt states that "the defendants have moved to dismiss each of the plaintiff's claims."
* The second excerpt mentions that the defendants will face a burden of proving scienter and reliance, among other things, which suggests that they are being sued as individuals.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the defendants in this case are UiPath and two of its executives.

**Q: What issues did the plaintiff raise about the ARR metric?**
*Processing time: 13.71s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the plaintiff raised several issues regarding the ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) metric:

1. The plaintiff argued that UiPath's use of ARR as a key metric was misleading because it did not accurately reflect the company's future revenue.
2. The plaintiff claimed that UiPath failed to disclose the limitations and potential flaws in the ARR metric, leading investors to rely too heavily on it.
3. The plaintiff alleged that the company's disclosures about ARR were incomplete or inaccurate, which misled investors.

These issues are raised in the context of a securities litigation case against UiPath and its executives, with the plaintiff arguing that the defendants' statements regarding ARR were false or misleading and caused harm to investors.

**Q: How did UiPath allegedly mislead investors during the IPO?**
*Processing time: 19.35s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts, it appears that the plaintiff alleges that UiPath misled investors during the IPO by using a misleading metric, Annualized Renewal Run-Rate ("ARR"), to suggest that the company's business was growing and thriving. The plaintiff claims that UiPath failed to disclose material problems with its customer base, including stagnant or declining rates of growth, regular discounting of products, and the use of "ramping" contracts.

The excerpts suggest that the plaintiff alleges that UiPath's disclosures were misleading because they did not accurately reflect the company's financial condition. The plaintiff points out that UiPath's quarterly filings with the SEC sometimes disclosed stagnant or declining rates of growth even though revenue and ARR had grown year-over-year. Additionally, the plaintiff claims that UiPath failed to disclose that customers were reducing their business or stopping doing business with the company.

However, the excerpts also suggest that UiPath made fulsome disclosures about its financial condition, including the use of ARR as a metric, and warned investors not to place undue reliance on it as an indicator of future revenue. The court notes that the plaintiff has failed to explain why UiPath was not free to develop a bespoke measurement tool and describe that tool to investors so long as it did so accurately.

Overall, the answer best supported by the excerpts is that UiPath allegedly misled investors during the IPO by using a misleading metric (ARR) and failing to disclose material problems with its customer base.

**Q: What were the court's reasons for dismissing the Section 11 claims?**
*Processing time: 17.14s | Retrieved chunks: 4 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 1000*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the court's reasons for dismissing the Section 11 claims are as follows:

The court dismissed the Section 11 claims because the defendants made fulsome disclosures about their financial condition and adverse circumstances that the company was experiencing. The prospectus contained robust descriptions of these risks, which were not misleading. Specifically, the court noted that investors were able to track, quarter by quarter, whether revenue was adversely affected by competition and the company's failures to expand its business.

The court also cited the Supreme Court's recent ruling in Macquarie, which held that an omission must be a "pure" omission for there to be liability under Section 11. Since the Offering Documents did not contain a pure omission, the defendants will not face a claim based on this theory.

Additionally, the court noted that because there is no ¬ß 11 claim, plaintiffs will have the burden of proving scienter and reliance, among other things. This suggests that the court was dismissing the Section 11 claims due to the lack of liability under this theory, rather than any affirmative defense raised by the defendants.

Justification:

The most relevant portions supporting this conclusion are:

* "In light of these robust disclosures, the risk factors identified in the prospectus were not misleading."
* "Therefore, investors were able to track, quarter by quarter, whether revenue was adversely affected by competition and UiPath's failures to expand its business."
* "The claims based on these statements must be dismissed."

These passages suggest that the court found the disclosures made by the defendants to be sufficient and not misleading, which is a key factor in determining liability under Section 11. The court also cited the Supreme Court's ruling in Macquarie, which further supports its conclusion that there was no liability under this theory.

**Q: What does the opinion say about Rule 10b-5 violations?**
*Processing time: 12.08s | Retrieved chunks: 6 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 1500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the opinion states that the plaintiff's claims of Rule 10b-5 violations must be dismissed. The court notes that the SAC (Stipulation of Alleged Conduct) alleges that UiPath was experiencing difficulties competing with Microsoft by March of 2022, and that customers were bringing up Microsoft's robots in "about half" of their sales calls. However, the court finds that these allegations are vague and do not plausibly plead that the prospectus statements were misleading.

The opinion also notes that the SAC does not challenge as inaccurate the data presented in the graph showing six years of growth in ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) data from 2016 to 2021. The court concludes that the risk factors identified in the prospectus were not misleading, and that investors were able to track, quarter by quarter, whether revenue was adversely affected by competition and UiPath's failures to expand its business.

Therefore, based on these excerpts, it appears that the opinion does not support a finding of Rule 10b-5 violations.

**Q: When was the lawsuit filed and who was appointed lead plaintiff?**
*Processing time: 13.52s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts, the lawsuit was filed on September 6, 2023 by Samhita Gera as a putative class action. Paul Severt was appointed as lead plaintiff on December 1.

Justification:

The relevant excerpt is: "This action was filed on September 6, 2023 by Samhita Gera as a putative class action... As required by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (‚ÄúPSLRA‚Äù), the plaintiff published notice of the filing on September 6. By November 6, seven applications to be appointed lead plaintiff had been filed. On December 1, Paul Severt was appointed as lead plaintiff."

---

**Q: What happened on September 27, 2022?**
*Processing time: 5.14s | Retrieved chunks: 1 | Query complexity: simple | Adaptive k: 6 | Est. tokens: 250*

A: Based on the provided excerpts, there is no information about what happened on September 27, 2022. The excerpts only mention a securities litigation filed against UiPath and its executives in 2023, as well as a motion to dismiss the plaintiff's claims. There is no mention of any specific event or occurrence on September 27, 2022.

Therefore, I would answer that there is no information provided about what happened on September 27, 2022.

### Model: all-minilm-l6-v2

**Q: What was the core allegation made by the plaintiff?**
*Processing time: 20.17s | Retrieved chunks: 7 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 1750*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the core allegation made by the plaintiff is that the defendants violated ¬ß 11 of the Securities Act because the Offering Documents contained material misstatements and omissions.

The relevant excerpts are:

* The plaintiff alleges that the defendants violated ¬ß 11 of the Securities Act because the Offering Documents contained material misstatements and omissions.
* Section 11 provides in pertinent part: "In case any part of the registration statement, when such part became effective, contained an untrue statement or a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, any person acquiring such security may sue." (15 U.S.C. ¬ß 77k(a))
* The Securities Act requires that "companies issuing securities make a 'full and fair disclosure of information' in connection with a public offering." (New England Carpenters Guaranteed Annuity and Pension Funds v. DeCarlo, 80 F.4th 158, 168 (2d Cir. 2023), amended and superseded on rehearing, --- F.4th ---, 2023 WL 11965444 (Oct. 3, 2024))

Therefore, the core allegation made by the plaintiff is that the defendants failed to provide a "full and fair disclosure of information" in connection with the public offering, resulting in material misstatements and omissions in the Offering Documents.

**Q: Who were the defendants in this case?**
*Processing time: 4.42s | Retrieved chunks: 2 | Query complexity: simple | Adaptive k: 6 | Est. tokens: 500*

A: Based on the excerpts, the defendants in this securities litigation are:

UiPath and two of its executives.

This conclusion is supported by the following relevant portions:

* The excerpt states: "The defendants have moved to dismiss each of the plaintiff's claims."
* It also mentions that the motion is granted in part, indicating that there are multiple defendants involved.

---

**Q: What issues did the plaintiff raise about the ARR metric?**
*Processing time: 13.39s | Retrieved chunks: 7 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 1750*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the plaintiff raised three main issues regarding the ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) metric:

1. **Inflated revenue**: The plaintiff argued that the invoiced amounts included revenue that might never be realized in future years, such as customers not renewing their licenses or choosing not to use additional Robots added during the final months of a license.
2. **Non-recurring revenue**: The plaintiff pointed out that ARR included non-recurring revenue, such as one-time fees for implementation and service, which inflated the metric.
3. **Misleading definition**: The plaintiff claimed that the definition of ARR was misleading because it described it as a "key metric" and a better indicator of UiPath's financial health than GAAP metrics.

These issues were raised in the SAC (Statement of Alleged Claims) and are discussed in the Opinion, which concludes that the plaintiff has failed to plausibly plead that the defendants' statements regarding ARR were either false or misleading.

**Q: How did UiPath allegedly mislead investors during the IPO?**
*Processing time: 24.24s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts, it appears that UiPath allegedly misled investors during the IPO by:

1. Using a misleading metric, Annualized Renewal Run-Rate ("ARR"), to suggest that its financial outlook was stronger than it actually was.
2. Claiming that its "land-and-expand" business model was successful when it was not.
3. Understating the competitive threats that UiPath faced in the RPA market, especially from Microsoft Corporation.
4. Issuing risk disclosures that were misleading because they framed events that had already occurred as merely hypothetical.

These allegations are based on the plaintiff's claims and are taken as true for purposes of this motion. The defendants have moved to dismiss each of the plaintiff's claims, arguing that the risk factors identified in the prospectus were not misleading and that investors were able to track UiPath's financial condition quarter by quarter.

Justification:

The excerpts suggest that UiPath allegedly misled investors during the IPO by presenting a rosier picture of its financial outlook than was actually the case. The plaintiff alleges that UiPath used ARR as a metric to suggest that its revenue growth was stronger than it actually was, when in fact the company was experiencing difficulties maintaining its growth. Additionally, the plaintiff claims that UiPath overstated the success of its "land-and-expand" business model and understated the competitive threats it faced from Microsoft.

The excerpts also suggest that UiPath's risk disclosures were misleading because they framed events that had already occurred as merely hypothetical. For example, the prospectus described the RPA industry generally and the products that UiPath offers, but did not disclose the specific challenges that the company was facing at the time of the IPO.

Overall, the excerpts suggest that UiPath allegedly misled investors during the IPO by presenting a misleading picture of its financial outlook and understating the competitive threats it faced.

**Q: What were the court's reasons for dismissing the Section 11 claims?**
*Processing time: 16.76s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the provided excerpts, the court dismissed the Section 11 claims because:

1. The plaintiff did not plausibly plead any material omission from the Offering Documents.
2. The original complaint, filed in September of 2023, did not plead a ¬ß 11 claim, and therefore, the statute of limitations period had run, making the claim time-barred.
3. American Pipe tolling fails to revive the time-barred claim because it cannot extend the statute of repose contained within ¬ß 13 of the Securities Act.

The court also noted that the plaintiff's reliance on cases permitting the substitution of a named plaintiff to cure a standing defect was misplaced, as those cases did not involve a substituted plaintiff bringing a previously unpleaded and time-barred claim.

---

**Q: What does the opinion say about Rule 10b-5 violations?**
*Processing time: 7.29s | Retrieved chunks: 2 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 500*

A: Based on the provided excerpts, there is no mention of Rule 10b-5 violations. The discussion focuses on jurisdictional defects, statute of repose, and relation back doctrine under Rule 15(c) in the context of Securities Act claims (¬ß 11 and ¬ß 13). Therefore, I conclude that the opinion does not address Rule 10b-5 violations.

Justification: The excerpts primarily discuss the plaintiff's attempts to revive time-barred claims and the application of American Pipe tolling. There is no mention of Rule 10b-5 or any related concepts.

**Q: When was the lawsuit filed and who was appointed lead plaintiff?**
*Processing time: 11.60s | Retrieved chunks: 8 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2000*

A: Based on the excerpts, the lawsuit was filed on September 6, 2023 by Samhita Gera as a putative class action. Paul Severt was appointed as lead plaintiff on December 1, 2023.

Justification:

* The first excerpt states that "This action was filed on September 6, 2023 by Samhita Gera as a putative class action."
* The second excerpt mentions that "On December 1, Paul Severt was appointed as lead plaintiff."

---

**Q: What happened on September 27, 2022?**
*Processing time: 9.19s | Retrieved chunks: 6 | Query complexity: simple | Adaptive k: 6 | Est. tokens: 1500*

A: Based on the provided excerpts, there is no mention of any event occurring on September 27, 2022. The excerpts primarily discuss UiPath's earnings conference calls, financial results, and presentations at various conferences during the Class Period (which appears to be a period of time prior to the filing of the securities litigation in 2023). There is also discussion about the motion to dismiss certain claims brought by the plaintiff.

Therefore, I would answer that there is no information provided regarding what happened on September 27, 2022.

**Q: What was the core allegation made by the plaintiff?**
*Processing time: 13.74s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the core allegation made by the plaintiff is that the defendants violated ¬ß 11 of the Securities Act because the Offering Documents contained material misstatements and omissions. Specifically, the plaintiff alleges that the risk factors disclosed in the Offering Documents were misleading because two of the risks which had already materialized were described as hypothetical risks.

---

**Q: Who were the defendants in this case?**
*Processing time: 7.29s | Retrieved chunks: 6 | Query complexity: simple | Adaptive k: 6 | Est. tokens: 1500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the defendants in this case are:

* UiPath
* Daniel Dines (Chairman of UiPath's Board of Directors and CEO)
* Ashim Gupta (CFO)

These individuals are mentioned as being sued by the plaintiff for allegedly violating various securities laws, including Section 11 of the Securities Act.

**Q: What issues did the plaintiff raise about the ARR metric?**
*Processing time: 14.70s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts, the plaintiff raised several issues regarding the ARR (Annualized Revenue Run Rate) metric:

1. The invoiced amounts included revenue that might never be realized in future years, such as revenue from "ramping" licenses, which added more Robots in the final month or months of a license.
2. The ARR was inflated because it included non-recurring revenue, such as one-time fees for implementation and service.
3. The definition of ARR was misleading because UiPath described it as a "key metric" and a better indicator of its financial health than GAAP metrics.

The plaintiff argued that these issues made the ARR metric artificially inflated and not a reliable indicator of future revenue.

**Q: How did UiPath allegedly mislead investors during the IPO?**
*Processing time: 49.96s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts, it appears that UiPath allegedly misled investors during the IPO in several ways:

1. Misleading metric: The SAC (Securities Class Action) alleges that UiPath used a misleading metric, Annualized Renewal Run-Rate ("ARR"), to suggest that its financial outlook was stronger than it actually was.
2. "Land-and-Expand" business model: The SAC claims that UiPath claimed its "land-and-expand" business model was successful when it was not. This model involves attempting to "land" new customers and then "expand" those customers' use of UiPath products.
3. Understating competitive threats: The SAC alleges that UiPath understated the competitive threats it faced in the RPA market, especially from Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft").
4. Misleading risk disclosures: The SAC claims that UiPath's risk disclosures were misleading because they framed events that had already occurred as merely hypothetical.

These allegations are based on statements made by UiPath in its offering documents, quarterly and annual filings with the SEC, press releases, and conference calls with investors.

**Q: What were the court's reasons for dismissing the Section 11 claims?**
*Processing time: 22.95s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the provided excerpts, the court dismissed the Section 11 claims because:

1. The plaintiff did not plausibly plead any material omission from the Offering Documents.
2. The limitations period began when "a reasonable investor conducting a timely and diligent inquiry would have discovered the untrue statement or omission." (15 U.S.C. ¬ß 77m)
3. The plaintiff's assertion that the defendants omitted material information from the Offering Documents in violation of a duty to disclose was not supported by the pleadings.
4. The court held that American Pipe tolling could not extend the statute of repose contained within ¬ß 13 of the Securities Act, and therefore, the plaintiff's reliance on American Pipe tolling fails.

The court also noted that because there is no Section 11 claim, plaintiffs will have the burden of proving scienter and reliance, among other things; the defendants will not face a strict liability claim. Additionally, the court cited Macquarie, which held that Section 11 imposes absolute liability on the issuer of a registration statement if certain conditions are met, but does not create liability for failure to speak on a subject at all.

Overall, the court dismissed the Section 11 claims because they were untimely and lacked sufficient pleading to support the allegations.

**Q: What does the opinion say about Rule 10b-5 violations?**
*Processing time: 204.30s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the opinion states that to state a claim for material misrepresentations or omissions under Rule 10b-5(b), a plaintiff must plead:

1. A material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant;
2. Scienter (i.e., the defendant acted with the required state of mind);
3. A connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security;
4. Reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission;
5. Economic loss; and
6. Loss causation.

The opinion also notes that Rule 10b-5(b) requires "identifying affirmative assertions" before determining if other facts are needed to make those statements "not misleading." Additionally, the opinion states that a statement is materially misleading when the defendants' representations, taken together and in context, would have misled a reasonable investor.

Furthermore, the opinion holds that American Pipe tolling cannot extend the statute of repose contained within ¬ß 13 of the Securities Act. It also rebuffs the effort to use the relation-back doctrine under Rule 15(c) to permit members of a putative class "who are not named parties, to intervene in the class action as named parties in order to revive claims that were dismissed from the class complaint for want of jurisdiction."

In summary, the opinion emphasizes the importance of pleading material misrepresentations or omissions with particularity and highlights the requirements for establishing a Rule 10b-5(b) violation.

A: Based on the excerpts, the lawsuit was filed on September 6, 2023, by Samhita Gera as a putative class action. Paul Severt was later appointed as lead plaintiff on December 1, 2023.

Justification:

**Q: What was the core allegation made by the plaintiff?**
*Processing time: 21.06s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the core allegation made by the plaintiff is that the defendants (UiPath's management) made misleading statements and omissions in the Offering Documents, which masked UiPath's difficulties in gaining and retaining customers and the impact of competitors such as Microsoft. The plaintiff alleges that these misstatements and omissions violated Section 11 of the Securities Act, which requires companies to make a "full and fair disclosure of information" in connection with a public offering.

The specific allegations include:

* Misleading use of the Annualized Renewal Run-Rate (ARR) metric to suggest that UiPath's financial outlook was stronger than it actually was
* Claiming that UiPath's "land-and-expand" business model was successful when it was not
* Understating the competitive threats that UiPath faced in the RPA market, especially from Microsoft Corporation
* Issuing risk disclosures that were misleading because they framed events that had already occurred as merely hypothetical

The plaintiff argues that these misstatements and omissions caused investors to make decisions based on false or incomplete information, resulting in economic loss.

**Q: Who were the defendants in this case?**
*Processing time: 10.25s | Retrieved chunks: 6 | Query complexity: simple | Adaptive k: 6 | Est. tokens: 1500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the defendants in this case are:

Daniel Dines, who served as the Chairman of UiPath's Board of Directors and CEO, and Ashim Gupta, UiPath's CFO.

Justification:

The excerpts mention that the SAC (the complaint) asserts claims against "the defendants" without specifying their names. However, it is later clarified in the excerpts that the two individual defendants are Daniel Dines and Ashim Gupta, who served as the Chairman of the Board and CEO of UiPath, respectively, and CFO of UiPath.

Specifically, excerpt 2 states: "The two individual defendants are Daniel Dines, who served as the Chairman of UiPath's Board of Directors (the 'Board') and the CEO of UiPath, and Ashim Gupta, UiPath's CFO."

**Q: What issues did the plaintiff raise about the ARR metric?**
*Processing time: 13.83s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: The plaintiff raised several issues about the ARR (Annualized Renewal Run-Rate) metric:

1. The invoiced amounts included revenue that might never be realized in future years, as customers may choose not to renew licenses.
2. The invoiced amounts were inflated because they included non-recurring revenue such as one-time fees for implementation and service.
3. The definition of ARR was misleading because UiPath described it as a "key metric" and a better indicator of its financial health than the GAAP metrics.

The plaintiff argued that these issues made the ARR metric artificially inflated and therefore misleading to investors.

**Q: How did UiPath allegedly mislead investors during the IPO?**
*Processing time: 17.20s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, it appears that UiPath allegedly misled investors during the IPO by:

1. Using a misleading metric, Annualized Renewal Run-Rate (ARR), which suggested that the company's financial outlook was stronger than it actually was.
2. Claiming that its "land-and-expand" business model was successful when it was not.
3. Understating the competitive threats that UiPath faced in the RPA market, especially from Microsoft Corporation.
4. Issuing risk disclosures that were misleading because they framed events that had already occurred as merely hypothetical.

These allegations are based on the SAC's claims that the defendants' statements artificially inflated the price of UiPath's stock during the Class Period. The SAC asserts that these misrepresentations were made in the Offering Documents and subsequent SEC filings, and that they were not corrected until later in the Class Period when partial disclosures were made.

The excerpts also suggest that UiPath repeatedly warned investors about the limitations of ARR as a metric for future revenue, but this did not prevent the plaintiff from alleging that the company's use of ARR was misleading.

**Q: What were the court's reasons for dismissing the Section 11 claims?**
*Processing time: 18.55s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the court's reasons for dismissing the Section 11 claims are:

1. The plaintiff did not plausibly plead that any misstatements were made in the Offering Documents.
2. The only statements that survived this motion to dismiss fall within the third category and relate to competition with Microsoft.
3. The SAC fails to plausibly plead that the defendants' statements regarding ARR (annualized revenue run rate) were either false or misleading, as UiPath made ample disclosures regarding both the nature of the ARR metric and its limitations.
4. The plaintiff's allegations regarding ARR are dismissed because the calculation was based on amounts invoiced during a particular time period and warned against using this metric to predict future revenue.
5. The SAC's allegations regarding competition with Microsoft are vague and plead at best that UiPath lost some deals to Microsoft, which is not inconsistent with the statements by Dines cited above.

Overall, the court found that the plaintiff did not adequately plead a Section 11 claim, as there was no plausible allegation of material misstatements or omissions in the Offering Documents.

**Q: What does the opinion say about Rule 10b-5 violations?**
*Processing time: 19.37s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts from Local 773 Pension Fund v. Danske Bank A/S, I conclude that the opinion states that:

* Rule 10b-5(b) makes it unlawful to omit material facts in connection with buying or selling securities when that omission renders statements made misleading.
* The rule does not apply to "pure omissions," which occur when a speaker says nothing, in circumstances that do not give any particular meaning to that silence.
* Even a duty to disclose certain information does not automatically render silence misleading under Rule 10b-5(b).
* Instead, the rule requires identifying affirmative assertions before determining if other facts are needed to make those statements "not misleading."

Justification:

The opinion cites Macquarie Infrastructure Corp. v. Moab Partners, L.P., 601 U.S. 257, 259 (2024), which provides guidance on Rule 10b-5(b) and the concept of "pure omissions." The court in Local 773 Pension Fund v. Danske Bank A/S applies this precedent to conclude that the defendants' statements regarding competition with Microsoft are not misleading under Rule 10b-5(b).

**Q: What issues did the plaintiff raise about the ARR metric?**
*Processing time: 13.06s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the plaintiff raised several issues regarding the ARR (Annualized Revenue Run Rate) metric:

1. The invoiced amounts included revenue that might never be realized in future years, as customers may choose not to renew licenses.
2. The ARR was inflated because it included non-recurring revenue such as one-time fees for implementation and service.
3. The definition of ARR was misleading because UiPath described it as a "key metric" and a better indicator of its financial health than the GAAP metrics.

These issues were raised in the SAC (Statement of Alleged Claims) and are discussed in the Opinion excerpts provided.

**Q: How did UiPath allegedly mislead investors during the IPO?**
*Processing time: 22.04s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the provided excerpts, it appears that the SAC (Securities Class Action) alleges that UiPath misled investors during the IPO by making four sets of misrepresentations:

1. Statements concerning ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue): The SAC claims that UiPath's statements about ARR were misleading because they did not accurately reflect the company's financial performance.
2. Statements concerning "land-and-expand" business model: The SAC alleges that UiPath's statements about its ability to expand its business and increase revenue from existing customers were misleading, as the company was actually experiencing difficulties in this area.
3. Statements regarding competitors, particularly Microsoft: The SAC claims that UiPath's statements about its competitive position and market share were misleading, as the company was struggling to compete with Microsoft and other rivals.
4. Risk factors identified in SEC filings: The SAC alleges that the risk factors disclosed by UiPath in its SEC filings were misleading because they did not accurately reflect the company's financial condition or business performance.

However, based on the excerpts provided, it appears that the court has dismissed some of these claims, finding that:

* The statements about ARR were not misleading, as UiPath warned investors not to rely solely on this metric and provided GAAP-compliant financial results.
* The statements about the "land-and-expand" business model were taken out of context and did not state a violation of securities laws.
* The risk factors disclosed by UiPath in its SEC filings were not misleading, as they accurately reflected the company's financial condition and business performance.

Therefore, it appears that the court has granted the motion to dismiss some of the plaintiff's claims, finding that UiPath did not mislead investors during the IPO.

**Q: What were the court's reasons for dismissing the Section 11 claims?**
*Processing time: 20.87s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the court dismissed the Section 11 claims because they were time-barred. The plaintiff did not plead a plausible claim under Section 11, and the original complaint filed in September 2023 did not include a Section 11 claim. Therefore, the one-year statute of limitations period began when the plaintiff discovered or should have discovered the untrue statement or omission, which was after the filing of the original complaint.

The court also held that American Pipe tolling does not apply to revive a time-barred Section 11 claim. The doctrine only permits the substitution of a named plaintiff to cure a standing defect, but it does not permit the filing of an amended class action complaint containing a time-barred claim.

Additionally, the court noted that the plaintiff's reliance on cases permitting the substitution of a named plaintiff to cure a standing defect was misplaced, as those cases did not involve a time-barred claim. The court also distinguished the case of MYL Litig. Recovery I LLC v. Mylan N.V., which relied on American Pipe tolling to permit an individual plaintiff who had opted out of a class action to bring a time-barred claim under Section 18 of the Exchange Act.

In summary, the court dismissed the Section 11 claims because they were time-barred and did not meet the pleading requirements under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

**Q: What does the opinion say about Rule 10b-5 violations?**
*Processing time: 25.18s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the provided excerpts from Local 773 Pension Fund v. Danske Bank A/S, here is my analysis:

The opinion discusses Rule 10b-5(b) and its application to the case at hand. The key points are:

1. Rule 10b-5(b) makes it unlawful to omit material facts in connection with buying or selling securities when that omission renders statements made misleading (Macquarie Infrastructure Corp. v. Moab Partners, L.P., 601 U.S. 257, 259 (2024)).
2. The rule does not apply to "pure omissions," which occur when a speaker says nothing, in circumstances that do not give any particular meaning to that silence (Id. at 263).
3. Even a duty to disclose certain information does not automatically render silence misleading under Rule 10b-5(b) (Id. at 265). Instead, the rule requires identifying affirmative assertions before determining if other facts are needed to make those statements "not misleading" (Id. at 264).

In the context of this case, the opinion notes that the plaintiff does not challenge the accuracy of UiPath's reported financial information and does not assert that the ARR figures appearing in the Company's SEC filings were false. Instead, the plaintiff argues that the ARR metric itself was "artificially inflated" for three reasons.

Therefore, based on these excerpts, I conclude that:

**Answer:** The opinion states that Rule 10b-5(b) requires identifying affirmative assertions before determining if other facts are needed to make those statements "not misleading." It also notes that the plaintiff's claims do not challenge the accuracy of UiPath's reported financial information and does not assert that the ARR figures appearing in the Company's SEC filings were false.

*Processing time: 16.34s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the lawsuit was filed on September 6, 2023 by Samhita Gera as a putative class action. Paul Severt was appointed as lead plaintiff on December 1, 2023.

Justification:

The relevant excerpt is: "This action was filed on September 6, 2023 by Samhita Gera as a putative class action... As required by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (‚ÄúPSLRA‚Äù), the plaintiff published notice of the filing on September 6. By November 6, seven applications to be appointed lead plaintiff had been filed. On December 1, Paul Severt was appointed as lead plaintiff."

This excerpt clearly states that the lawsuit was filed on September 6, 2023 and that Paul Severt was appointed as lead plaintiff on December 1, 2023.
